# What?
A small script to make scrollbar in cocos-creator draggable, like so
![Yo, slow connection? Can't help it :v](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tng2903/cc-draggable-scroll-bar/master/recording.gif)

# Why?
Because scrollbar in cocos-creator is not... draggable?
I know that any one can just write up this little thing in 5 minutes, but me putting this one up will help you reduce that time.

# How to use?
1. Add DraggableScrollBar script to the scrollbar object.
2. Drag and drop references for ScrollBar component and its ScrollView.
3. Profit.

# Bugs?
Who knows, if you find some, make an issue and maybe I will fix it if I have free time :+1:
